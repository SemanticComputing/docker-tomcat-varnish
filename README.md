# tomcat-varnish

## Notes

### Tomcat

Environment variables:
```
CATALINA_HOME # /usr/share/tomcat8
CATALINA_BASE # /var/lib/tomcat8
PATH_WEBAPPS # $CATALINA_BASE/webapps
PATH_LOG_TOMCAT # /var/log/tomcat8
FILE_LOG_TOMCAT_OUT # $PATH_LOG_TOMCAT/catalina.out
FILE_LOG_TOMCAT_ERROR # $PATH_LOG_TOMCAT/catalina.err
FILE_PID_TOMCAT # /run/tomcat.pid
FILE_CONF_TOMCAT_LOGGING # $CATALINA_BASE/conf/logging.properties
RUN_TOMCAT_VARNISH # /run-tomcat-varnish.sh 
EXEC_TOMCAT_VARNISH # exec $RUN_TOMCAT_VARNISH
JAVA_XMS # Control JVMs heap memory, java -Xms ...
JAVA_XMX # Control JVMs heap memory, java -Xmx ...
```
These are defined at built-time and are not inteded to be changed.

By default the tomcat app resides at `PATH_WEBAPPS`. You could mount it or copy it over in a downstream image. If you need to do a custom entrypoint, you can call `$EXEC_TOMCAT_VARNISH` to launch tomcat+varnish.
